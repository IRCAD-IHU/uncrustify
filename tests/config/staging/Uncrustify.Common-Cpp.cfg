# without this, uncrustify will parse and process the contents of #defines, which is super unstable. very easy to get into edge cases it does not support,
# so just have it treat #defines as black boxes. this 'set' will convert #define to a PP_IGNORE, which keeps all of the contents of the #define as
# an unparsed PREPROC_BODY, only doing indentation and that's it. note that this causes all define-related options to be ignored.
